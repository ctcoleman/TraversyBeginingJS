Begining Modern JavaScript - Brad Traversy - Udemy

Christopher Coleman

...This is just a simple collection of projects from Brad Traversy's Udemy Class - Begining Modern JavaScript....

Really great course....covered everything from basic JS to advanced vanilla JS. The projects were fun and relatable.
It definitely built on my skills. I feel really confident using vanilla JS and can't wait to bring these skills over to Node.JS next.
I think after this I will look at TypeScript or React. I really feel prepared to take my skills in any direction after this Vanilla JS course.

I'll leave a link to Traversy's Udemy link here if anyone is interested after checking out these projects...
